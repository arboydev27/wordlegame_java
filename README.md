# wordlegame_java
A simple implementation of the popular word-guessing game Wordle. This Java-based game challenges players to guess a hidden five-letter word in up to six attempts. It provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether letters are correct, in the correct position, or present in the word but in a different position.
